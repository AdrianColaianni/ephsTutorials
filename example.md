# This is what you are teaching

If necessary, provide a very brief description of what will be accomplished.
For most tutorials, this will be self-evident.
If there is a title image, it should be above this paragraph.
You may also include difficulty/time estimate below:

- 🕛Time estimate: 10 min
- ⭐Difficulty:	🌟🌟⭐⭐⭐ 2/5

## Required materials/knowledge

- You may admit this section if only requirement is a laptop

## Instructions

1. Now using an ordered list,
2. give the directions
3. Do **not** add unnecessary blank lines between items.
4. If necessary,
5. an image can be included between some instructions if needed to explain something particular.
6. But that should be kept to a minimum to reduce bandwidth and aid in simplicity.

## Contribution

Here, just put your name and links to yourself (maybe a website) if you want.
You may say "Anonymous" or a screenname if desired.
If you add something substantial to an already existing tutorial (including an image) you may add your name below with the contribution in parens.

Note that your commit name will be used to sign the recipe, so for full
anonymity either commit with a name that can't be traced back to you, or ask
someone else to commit for you.
