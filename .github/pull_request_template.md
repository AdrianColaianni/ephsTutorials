<!--
- Model submission files after [example.md](example.md). Put them in `src/`.
- Tutorials should start with a title, with a single `#`, *on the first line*. No empty line at the top, no trailing line at the end. The file needs to be `\n` terminated in linux-fashion (if you're on linux you don't need to care, it should be automatic).
- File names should be the name of the tutorial with words separated by hyphens (`-`). Not underscores, and definitely not spaces.
- Tutorials must be simple and easy to follow, i.e. no extra complexity, command prompt or advanced diagnosis.
- Don't include laptop and other basic things in the materials list.
